          WARNING: This CI only tests if tablex-test.typ compiles. It does not test
          if the generated PDF output differed from the reference tablex-test.pdf.
          For now, you will have to manually compare the compiled PDF and the PDF
          in the repository before committing. This will be dealt with in the future.
          Thanks for understanding.
